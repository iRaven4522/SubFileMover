# SubFileMover

very simpleish python program that took me months to figure out- thanks ADHD! :D

mainly for use with files generated by the educational web application Schoology for people at my school/districts who use it. as of recently, downloading submitted work from an assignment from all students places it in a .zip file, with the actual work buried under many folders (in this case, the students name, revision number, and finally the file itself)

a modified version of this program was submitted for my AP Performance Task, though that version isn't included for various reasons
